## Summary of Learning Journey

### 1. **Embeddings**
#### 1.1 Image Embeddings
- **Definition:** Lower-dimensional representations of images.
- **Purpose:** Capture meaningful image information and features.

#### 1.2 Sentence Embeddings
- **Definition:** Vector space representations of sentences, capturing semantic information.
- **Purpose:** Useful for NLP tasks like similarity comparison and text classification.

#### 1.3 Vectors Similarity and Distance Metrics
- **Metrics:** Euclidean Distance, Dot Product, Cosine Similarity.

#### 1.4 Vectors Searching Metrics
- **Algorithms:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW).
- **Note:** HNSW is faster than KNN and is the default algorithm in Weaviate Vector DB.

### 2. **Vector-DB (Weaviate)**
#### 2.1 Introduction
- **Topics Covered:** Embedding Client creation, schema creation, inserting embeddings, querying similar vectors.
- **Operations:** CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Search Types:** Dense (Semantic) Search, Sparse Search (B25).
- **Resource:** [ Dense Search, Sparse Search (B25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziiF1eFM3_4).
