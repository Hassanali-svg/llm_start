# Embeddings/L1_Embeddings.ipynb Summary

## Image Embeddings
- **Definition:** Image embeddings refer to the representation of images in a lower-dimensional space.
- **Purpose:** They are used to capture meaningful information and features of images.
- **Method:** [Specify the method(s) used in the notebook for image embedding.]

## Sentence Embeddings
- **Definition:** Sentence embeddings represent sentences in a vector space, capturing semantic information.
- **Purpose:** Useful for various natural language processing tasks like similarity comparison and text classification.
- **Method:** [Specify the method(s) used in the notebook for sentence embedding.]

## Similarity Metrics
### 1. Euclidean Distance
- **Definition:** Measures the straight-line distance between two vectors in the space.
- **Formula:** \( \text{{Euclidean distance}} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2} \)
- **Use Case:** Useful for comparing vectors in terms of their magnitude.

### 2. Dot Product
- **Definition:** Computes the sum of the product of corresponding elements of two vectors.
- **Formula:** \( \text{{Dot Product}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \cdot y_i \)
- **Use Case:** Measures the alignment between vectors.

### 3. Hamming Distance
- **Definition:** Measures the number of positions at which corresponding elements are different.
- **Formula:** \( \text{{Hamming Distance}} = \text{{number of differing elements}} \)
- **Use Case:** Applicable to binary vectors, often used in error detection and correction.

### 4. Cosine Similarity
- **Definition:** Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
- **Formula:** \( \text{{Cosine Similarity}} = \frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\| \cdot \|y\|} \)
- **Use Case:** Indicates the cosine of the angle, providing a measure of similarity irrespective of magnitude.

## Conclusion
